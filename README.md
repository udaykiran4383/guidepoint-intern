# 🎬 Movie Explorer App

A responsive and user-friendly Movie Explorer application built using **ReactJS**. This project allows users to search, explore, and favorite movies with smooth navigation and an appealing UI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Homepage**: Displays a responsive grid of movies with Poster, Title, Year, and a ⭐ "Favorite" button.
- **Search**: Real-time filtering of movies based on the title input.
- **Favorites Page**: View and manage your list of favorite movies.
- **Movie Details Page (Bonus)**: Access detailed movie information including Genre, Plot, Ratings, and more.
- **Persistent Favorites**: All favorite movies are stored using `localStorage` to maintain state across sessions.
- **Footer**: Contains contact information and links to social media profiles like LinkedIn and GitHub.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** (with Functional Components and Hooks)
- **React Router** for navigation between pages
- **CSS** (Mobile-first responsive design)
- **JavaScript** (ES6+ features)
- **LocalStorage API** for persistent state management

## 💡 Assumptions

- Used the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for fetching movie data.
